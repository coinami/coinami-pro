This is the CryptoCurrency Application for CoinAMI.

# Installation

Firstly, clone the project.
```
git clone https://github.com/myozka/coinami.git
```

Open the coin-interface folder and execute the following command

```
sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
sudo python setup.py install
```

If you encounter any problem, please report it immediately to developers. 
Also, you might likely be missing PyQt4. To install PyQt4 to your system:

```
sudo apt-get install python-qt4
```

# Starting Client

Both GUI and CLI are written as python executables. You can execute either of them but we suggest to use GUI first.
After starting GUI, create a wallet for yourself. Client will automatically start with this new wallet.

This cryptocurrency is developed by Zack Hess and contains very fundamentals of Bitcoin. We changed it to be centralized and added a gui.
